	<p>Broca</p>
	  <p>A neuroscience term. The region of the brain that is responsible for fluent speech. It is diffrent from what may be called the speech center,
	  the werincke area, or the visual cortex, or the hippocampus (the part of the brain responsible for memory. The Broca is different because it is
	  not a specialized region of the brain, but rather a super dense network of neurons that connect the werincke area of the brain to another area
	  of the brain. It is responsible for fluency.</p>
	  <p> Broca\u2019s area appears to act as an intermediary between the temporal cortex, which organizes incoming sensory information, and the motor cortex, which carries out the movements of the mouth, the researchers found. \u201cBroca\u2019s area shuts down during the actual delivery of speech, but it may remain active during conversation as part of planning future words and full sentences,\u201d says lead author Adeen Flinker, now a postdoctoral researcher at New York University who did the research while he was a Ph.D. student at the University of California, Berkeley.

Flinker says neuroscientists have traditionally organized the brain\u2019s language center into two main regions: one for perceiving speech, and one for producing speech. \u201cThis new finding helps us move toward a less dichotomous view, where Broca\u2019s area is not simply a center for speech production but rather a critical area for integrating and coordinating information across brain regions.\u201d
